            While the observation of objects in <strong> space—known </strong> as astronomy—pre-dates
            reliable recorded history, it was the development of large <em>liquid-fueled</em> rocket engines
            during the early 20th century that allowed space exploration to become a practical possibility.<br> 
            Common rationales for exploring <u>space include advancing </u> scientific research, uniting different 
            nations and ensuring the future survival of humanity.<br> 
            Space exploration has often been used as a proxy competition for geopolitical rivalries such as 
            the Cold War.<br> 
            The early era of space exploration was driven by a "Space Race" between the Soviet Union and the
            United States; the launch of the first man-made object to orbit the Earth, the USSR's Sputnik 1, 
            on October 4, 1957, and the first Moon landing by the American Apollo 11 craft on July 20, 1969
            are often taken as the boundaries for this initial period.
